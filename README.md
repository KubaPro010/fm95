# fm95

FM95 is a audio processor for FM, it does:

- Pre-Emphasis
- Low Pass Filtering
- AGC
- Stereo (Polar too)
- SCA
- BS412 (mpx power limiter, simplest implementation ever)

Supports these inputs:

- Audio (via Pulse)
- MPX (via Pulse, basically passthrough, i don't recommend this unless you have something else than rds or sca to modulate, you could run chimer95 via here, also you have 10% allowed here to be guarenteed with no clipping)
- RDS (via Pulse, expects unmodulated RDS, rds95 is recommended here, in modulation this is quadrature to the pilot, number of channels is specified by the argument, each of the channels (max 4) go on these freqs: 57, 66.5, 71.25, 76)

and one output:

- MPX (via Pulse)

## How to compile?

Note that you're required also to load submodules, if you don't know what that means, ask ChatGPT

To compile you need `cmake`, `liquid-dsp` and `libpulse-dev`, if you have those then do these commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Done!

## CPU Usage?

Should run completly fine on a pi 5, fine on a pi 3b (30% cpu, 45% with lpf)

## Other Apps

FM95 also includes some other apps, such as chimer95 which generates GTS tones each half hour, and dcf95 which creates a DCF77 compatible signal, and vban95 now which is a buffered VBAN receiver. And now also SCA generation was moved to sca95 from fm95!

## Usage of other projects

The apps use inih by Ben Hoyt.
